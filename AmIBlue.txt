Am I blue?
Am I blue?
Ain't these tears
In these eyes tellin' you?
Am I blue?
You'll be too
If your schemes like your dreams
Done fell through
Was a time
I was her only one
Now I am
The sad and lonely one, oh yes I am
Was I gay?
Till today
Now she's gone and we're through
Am I blue?
Was a time
I was her only one
Now I am
The sad and lonely one
I'm such a lonely one
Was I gay?
Till today
Now she's gone and we're through
Am I blue?
